# Master's Grimoire
A Simple project to keep track of D&D campaign, characters, NPC and such.

Also, a project to try wasm with rust, desktop app development with Tauri, backend with golang and deployment on a kubernetes cluster with mkdocs for documentation as code.

The documentation with mkdocs should be able to deploy to github pages for better documentation. 

The frontend should be able to admit oauth 2.0 login, and web services should have authorization based on token.
